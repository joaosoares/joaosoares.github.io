title: Sapiens Takeaways

Finished on: Sunday, February 4, 2018

1. The human evolutionary process is fascinating, and so is thinking about our Sapiens ancestors as people with similar mental capabilities as us but with a completely different lifestyle.

2. At some point, we escaped from our own biology and began to register history. This has been accompanied by "revolutions", i. e., the maturation of the development of a key technology (fire, agriculture, money, debt) that allows people to collectively develop things that didn't exist before.

3. Ideologies, which can be religions, empires or economic theories, shape the collective mind of society. Even if we don't notice, we are surrounded by them.

4. The pace of development has accelerated, and today the world order is in constant flux compared to a mere 500 years ago. This is in part due to the ideology of Science and Liberalism which have encouraged the accumulation of knowledge over the years, leading to technological developments.

5. We can't know for sure where we're going next, but a big possibility is editing Life and creating augmented humans.
